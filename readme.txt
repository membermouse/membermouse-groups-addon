Groups allows you to sell \"seats\" of membership to one Group Leader or Business.

== Description ==
Groups allows you to extend MemberMouse\'s premium Member Management tool with the ability to sell \"seats of membership\" to your members. This gives your members the capability to add their own users to their own account. The beauty is that you can increase your profit by allowing your members to purchase membership with any varying amount of seats:

3 seats: $100/mo
5 seats: $120/mo
10 seats: $200/mo

This is the perfect solution for many different business models wanting to offer seats of membership:
B2B
Coaches
Churches
Sales Teams
and many more!
